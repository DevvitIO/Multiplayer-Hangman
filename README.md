This project is getting a reboot this year, hopefully just in time for Haktoberfest!

We're open to experienced people looking to try out a few tricks or offer help as well as anyone looking to build a starter portfolio.

## Purpose

A collab project between Redditors with the purpose to learn new technologies as we go. This project has issues of varying difficulties so all are welcome.
It was created to help devs advance in their skillset, have a bit of fun, and make something interesting.

## Running the project

In console:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DevvitIO/Multiplayer-Hangman.git
npm install
npm start # will run webpack-dev-server, rebuilding the site when changes are made to any of the files.

# If it doesn't open automatically from npm start, then
# navigate browser to http://localhost:3000/
```

If installation turns out to be more complicated than this, that is completely our fault and please do let us know.

## Seeking help

We're available on Discord, or you can post a specific issue in the issues list here. We like questions!
